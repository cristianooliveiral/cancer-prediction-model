# Cancer Prediction Model

This project focuses on building a cancer prediction model using machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze cancer-related datasets, preprocess the data, and train a model capable of predicting cancer types or the likelihood of cancer diagnosis based on various features.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw data files (e.g., .csv, .txt files).
- `scripts/`: Contains the data preprocessing, cleaning, and analysis scripts.
- `outputs/`: Contains the results generated by the processing scripts, such as cleaned datasets or model outputs.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**, a comprehensive resource that provides genomic data on a variety of cancers. You can access the TCGA data from the [GDC Portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/).
