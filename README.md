# Cancer Prediction Model

This project aims to develop a cancer prediction model using artificial intelligence techniques. The primary objective is to analyze cancer-related datasets, preprocess the data, and train a model capable of predicting cancer types or assessing the likelihood of a cancer diagnosis based on RNA-seq data.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the raw data files.
- `scripts/`: Contains the data preprocessing, cleaning, and analysis scripts.
- `outputs/`: Contains the results generated by the processing scripts.

## Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**, a comprehensive resource that provides genomic data on a variety of cancers. You can access the TCGA data from the [GDC Portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/).
